# ALT-F4-Tkinker-app
What do you want the computer to do? That's the question for a super duper app I made in 10 minutes (it's just a worse Windows 10 shutdown window). ***Please note that I don't create applications using Tkinker and especially not in Python. I just wanted to try to program something like this - just for fun.***
